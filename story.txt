Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <TOYS>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <KEYBOARDS>, I thought I would <BRAG> about
a little and see the <BEAUTIFUL> part of the <ARTICLE>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<CLIFF> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <MACHINE>;
whenever it is a <RAINY>, <HOT> November in my <MANSION>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<DREAMWALKING> before coffin <CATS>, and bringing up the rear of every <LIMOUSINE> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <CLOUDY>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <JUMPING> into the <CAVE>, and methodically
<CHERISHING> people's <MEMORIES> off—then, I account it high time to get to <BAGS> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <DOGS> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <HANDS> with me.
