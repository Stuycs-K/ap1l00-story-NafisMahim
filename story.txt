Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <BEYBLADES>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <PATIENCE>, I thought I would <THINK> about
a little and see the <UGLY> part of the <BOOK>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<MOUNTAIN> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <COMPUTER>;
whenever it is a <SUNNY>, <COLD> November in my <PENTHOUSE>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<RUNNING> before coffin <MOUSE>, and bringing up the rear of every <CAR> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <RAINY>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <JOGGING> into the <ROOM>, and methodically
<EATING> people's <THOUGHTS> off—then, I account it high time to get to <HOMEWORK> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <SHEEP> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <LAPTOPS> with me.
