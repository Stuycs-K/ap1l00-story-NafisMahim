Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <WORLDS>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <SCREENS>, I thought I would <LAUGH> about
a little and see the <WONDERFUL> part of the <MAGAZINE>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<HILL> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <ROBOT>;
whenever it is a <BUMMY>, <CHILLY> November in my <HUT>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<SLEEPWALKING> before coffin <LIONS>, and bringing up the rear of every <TAXI> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <TAINTED>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <HOPPING> into the <PLACE>, and methodically
<ENJOYING> people's <GAMES> off—then, I account it high time to get to <BACKPACKS> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <COWS> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <WINDOWS> with me.
