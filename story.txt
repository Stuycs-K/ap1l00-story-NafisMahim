Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <COINS>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <ORANGES>, I thought I would <SMIRK> about
a little and see the <LOVELY> part of the <CATALOG>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<HIGHWAY> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <DUDE>;
whenever it is a <CHALKY>, <GRITTY> November in my <TOMBSTONE>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<JAYWALKING> before coffin <CAKES>, and bringing up the rear of every <UBER> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <SMUDGED>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <CREEPING> into the <ABODE>, and methodically
<SUCKING> people's <SADNESS> off—then, I account it high time to get to <NEVADA> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <LIZARDS> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <GLASS> with me.
