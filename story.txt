Call Me Ishmael.

Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no **Monkeys**
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on *delights*, I thought I would *scream* about
a little and see the **lavish** part of the *bungalow*.

It is a way I have of driving off the *pathway* and regulating circulation.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the **future**;
whenever it is a *grim*, **scary** November in my *area*;
whenever I find myself involuntarily *dancing* before coffin *things*,
and bringing up the rear of every **vehicle** I meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
that it requires a **clean** moral principle to prevent me from deliberately *leaning* into the *walls*,
and methodically *taking* people's **belongings** off—then,

I account it high time to get to **Bangladesh** as soon as I can.


There is nothing surprising in this.

If they but knew it, almost all **laws** in their degree, some time or other...
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the *Constitution* with me.
